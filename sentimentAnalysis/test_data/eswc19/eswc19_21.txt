In this paper the authors present a strategy for supporting query translation for querying CSV data from OBDA engines such as SPARQL engines. Though file-based querying is a well-studied problem, the specific contribution is to use CSVW (CSV on the Web), i.e. metadata for tabular data, as well as R2RML and RML for describing mapping rules.
Based on a motivating example the paper discusses some difficulties - however, these hold for any kind of tabular textual data. 
The approach of query translation is based on the assumption that CSVW annotations and RML mappings are given. Based on this, the paper describes the actual query translation support of deriving  mappings in an informal way. Finally, a use case is briefly disussed.
Though, this approch solves a relevant problem there are several concerns:
* Neither the problem nor the mapping solutions are novel. There exist a lot of work on database wrappers (M. T. Roth and P. M. Schwarz. Donâ€™t Scrap It, Wrap It! A Wrapper Architecture for Legacy Data Sources. In VLDB, 1997; S.Idreos, I.Alagiannis, R.Johnson, and A.Ailamaki. Here are my Data Files. Here are my Queries. Where are my Results? In CIDR, 2011), external tables in SQL systems, data profiling, query systems on raw data (e.g. Ioannis Alagiannis, Renata Borovica, Miguel Branco, Stratos Idreos, Anastasia Ailamaki: NoDB: efficient query execution on raw data files. SIGMOD Conference 2012: 241-252), schema mapping approaches, query rewriting over mappings etc. which is completely ignored. For instance, the detection of column datatypes ("Generation of Restrictions") is addressed by data profiling techniques.
* Given that the main focus is on enabling query translation the details on the translation/mapping step are only briefly and informally described. So, more details in sect. 4.3 would be useful. Furthermore, instead of concrete predicate names a more conceptual discussion would be welcome.
* The approach is not evaluated at all - only a use case is briefly described.

In summary, the paper fails to make clear the specific contribution over the state of the art. Just using some W3C recommendations alone does not represent a novel idea.
