This resource paper proposes and develops an ontology for telecommunication networks with 84 concepts, 37 object properties and 59 datatype properties. The ontology follows the methodology proposed by Noy&McGuinness. Why not METHONTOLOGY in Lopez et.al1997? There exist several ones, based on which criteria you chose the methodology proposed by Noy et al?
The authors then propose a set of requirements to guide the construction of the ontology which is clear. I would only suggest connecting the requirements with their realization in the next session. Can you add the requirements identification to that part of the ontology that satisfies those requirements?
In the use case section, I would have expected a set of validation SPARQL queries over possible evaluation scenarios. 
The authors do not reuse an ontology pattern but they propose a pattern named Device-Interface-Link

There are a few sentences that need to be revised, see the attachment

Thanks to the authors for their detailed answer. I think the authors have answered correctly to all the raised issues by the reviewers. However, I see that there is still space for improvement which I am not sure the authors can address all of them in the camera ready. The newly added material need to be revised again.
