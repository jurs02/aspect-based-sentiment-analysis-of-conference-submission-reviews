The paper is well motivated, structured and written. In my opinion though does not have a scientific contribution but is a guide as to how one can implement a data integration engine using existing OBDA tools. From that perspective I consider that the contribution of the paper is more beneficial to software engineers who are working with integrating and/or querying multiple CSV files. Hence, I would suggest that the authors consider submitting the paper to a workshop instead to a conference such as ESWC.
