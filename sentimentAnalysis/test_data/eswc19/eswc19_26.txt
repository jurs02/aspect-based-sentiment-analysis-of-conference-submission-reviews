In summary, this work could be interesting but I feel it's at too early a stage to warrant publication right now. The task appears rather contrived and needs better situating and its relevance properly explained. As mentioned above, there are a number of issues which do not appear to be taken into consideration such as the possibility of objects being found equally in multiple rooms, the possibility of different types of the same object (ie underspecification of the object) and a lack of clarity in the explanation of the methodology. In terms of methodology, the approach is very simple and doesn't really push any boundaries - one can easily imagine some more interesting use of semantics that adds to this. Finally, it's really not clear that the system is of practical use - the accuracy of the system does not seem very high and there's no baseline - one could imagine many possibilities for a suitable baseline to compare against, including methods adopted by others on similar tasks. There are also a number of English issues to be fixed. The related work section has some references which are not really relevant, such as the music recommendations one - I'm quite sure there are better related references that one could refer to here.

In Section 3.1, it's not clear what you mean about pruning terms - how and why?
In the normalisation phase, it's not clear why multi-word terms should hinder retrieval of objects in a KB.
In the generation phase, state how many scenes were selected, and how the selection was made.
Section 5.1 is rather unclear - what do you mean by "reproduce the distribution provided in the gold standard"? 
The description of Full and Partial Coverage is confusing (and these names are a bit odd).
